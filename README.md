## Inspiration: How We Came Up With This Idea üí°

We noticed even perfectly accurate information can get twisted as it passes from person to person, just like the classic ‚Äútelephone game.‚Äù For instance, the word ‚ÄúPolish‚Äù might be taken as the country or as nail cleaner, and ‚Äúpresent‚Äù can mean now or gift, depending on who hears it. Misinterpretation often happens not because the facts are wrong, but because people miss the broader context.

> *‚ÄúWhat if there were a way to let everyone see the full picture, so that every nuance of a news article is preserved?‚Äù*

That question sparked Tea Time. By combining crowdsourced commentary with AI-driven sentiment analysis (to see how everyone comments) and bias analysis (to flag where an article slants), then providing a concise summary to guide interpretation, we ensure no detail is lost in transmission and that misinformation gets caught before it spreads.


This exploration led us to design the platform Tea Time as a responsive PWA with support for any device, tailored for Malaysia, that:

- **Aggregates news directly from Bernama and other sources**  
- **Allows anyone to comment** on any article, thus building a crowdsourced view of public sentiment  
- **Uses AI to classify comments** as positive, negative, or neutral  
- **Generates bias-analysis reports** on each article, flagging potential slants and offering reading guidance  
- **Highlights ‚Äúthe bigger picture‚Äù** to prevent misinterpretation by using AI  
- **Implements KYC verification** to ensure user accountability and constructive engagement  
- **Encrypts user data** using elliptic curve cryptography for secure storage in the database
